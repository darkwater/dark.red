This is my personal homepage. See [dark.red](https://dark.red/).

Note that files from content/static/ are hard linked in development mode and copied in production mode.

Project cover images
--------------------

The project covers are 640x480px images, scaled to 320x240dpi (so basically 320x240px but at 2x resolution).

To get the header background consistent, follow these steps in GIMP:
1. Select the top 100px
2. Apply a gaussian blur of 20px
3. Fully desaturate based on average
4. Adjust brightness by -127
