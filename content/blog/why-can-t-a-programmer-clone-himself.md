- title: Why can't a programmer clone himself?
- date: 2014 Aug 09

If you're a programmer, I can't imagine you've never had this problem: You've got this cool project you're working on.
After a while, your motivation starts to decrease. Then you get another idea. It's even more awesome than your current
project! Except you want to do both.

I want to talk about this, but I don't feel like writing a huge wall of text like last time, so I'll keep it short.

So for the past few weeks/months my main project was nvirc, an IRC client, except more complicated. It's pretty big.
During development I've been thinking about starting a blog. Being an 18 year old programmer hungry for programming
experience, of course I'd program the blog myself instead of using something like tumblr or similar.

..Why stop at making a simple site to post things about myself? I could go much bigger with this! I think GitHub is
supposed to be some kind of social medium for programmers. I don't feel it is and I think many would agree with me. So I
could make Novaember something programmers could use to write about their projects.

I've spent the past week or so thinking about this. I really feel like making that blogging platform. With a bit of luck
I might also get something usable before my motivation starts to drop. I'm still making the IRC client, I'm just not sure
when.

Can't think of anything else to talk about right now, so I guess I'll leave it at this. Opinions and questions are
welcome.
