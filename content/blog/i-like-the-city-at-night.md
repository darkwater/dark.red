- title: I like the city at night.
- date: 2015 Apr 08

Every Wednesday from 18h to 21h and every Friday from 19h to 22h I go to a place called SCN. I guess it's a youth
centre, but it's not just a place where children run around and do fun stuff, at least not when I'm there. I'm
surrounded mostly by people around my age. We do cool stuff with technology. Many of these people use Linux as their
main OS, can program stuff on at least a basic level, stuff like that.

Anyway, back to that city at night thing. While it's a cool place to hang out, I don't want to talk about SCN right now.
What I want to talk about is my ride back home, which is usually by bus.

Today, I missed my bus because I didn't watch the time. Because of this, I missed my transfer at the central station. I
had to wait about 20 minutes, so I walked around a bit.

I'm a programmer. Most of my time is spend smashing keys in some dark or otherwise enclosed area. In other words, I
barely go anywhere except home, internship, SCN, or sometimes a friend's place. I'm fine with that.

My ride home from SCN is when I put on some music (I wear headphones like all the time) and just look around. I'm not
sure what exactly I like. I guess the fact that it's dark is enough for me to like it.

So, I arrived at the central bus/train station. Little over 20 minutes had to be killed. So I just walked around a bit.
Time went slower than I had expected. It was a nice experience. I haven't been to the train part of the station for a
long while.

I'm not sure how to explain it, and the previous paragraphs probably made little sense, if any, but I liked it. I
couldn't finish this post on the busride home, so the last three paragraphs were written on the next day, and I guess I
forgot what I wanted to get to. So all you get is some vague story about what I did yesterday (preciously "today").

P.S. If you want to get out of the bus and you're either too slow or the driver forgot to open the back door, please
just ask him to open the door. You don't have to wait for the next stop. Even I'm not that shy.
